## [alphabet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alphabet)

(whithout trailing `s`)

I do not say this package doesn't work. I think it will work perfectly, but it
has less features:
{: .notice--warning}

Seems a good alternative, right? But:

* It only supports the Latin alphabet.
* It is larger. (The size is equal to this package's size, but this package
  includes more.)
* It is only [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) and not 
  [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) etc.
* When did the author last update it? Right.
